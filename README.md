# PasswordGame

This is a game currently being developed to promote the usage of computationally secure password schemas that are also humanly usable. 
Even if an adversary has access to some number of your passwords, he will still be unable to guess your next one up until a certain number.
For many individuals, the same password is used to access hundreds of websites. As a result, if an adversary learns of even one of these passwords,
he can take over all such accounts. By using some of our password schemas, we hope to start a change toward higher security for all.
